******Technologies Involved:******

******Project statement:******  
This is the frontend interface for a web-based store that allows for the renting of personal backyards to the general public. There will be 2 types of users: customers and partners. The customer will go through a list of available backyards and book an event there at a specific date, while the partner will put up postings for available backyards to the customers. Note that a singular partner can have multiple backyards and a singular customer can book multiple events at one or many backyards. Note hence that both types of clients will first need to create an account and login to map data.
